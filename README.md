Velocimeter for Juno
====================

So uhh... this is basically a failed attempt. But here's what I was trying to do.

I've had several ideas and some of them might not be necessary; for example, I
wanted to create a simple component that would fire an event, but it's possible
this can be done with a stock MFD component. It's a bit clunky though.

The main thing I want to do is provide more information to Vizzy scripts. So far
though, I haven't found a way for a mod to provide new Vizzy node types. My goal
is to get information like "show the relative inclination between my orbit and
my target's" or other info direct from the target orbit. This would allow a Vizzy
script to create a planned burn just like my "Plane Match" button in the KSP
equivalent to this mod.

But for the moment, this is a complete stub. All I've achieved is "make a mod,
get it installed". It doesn't even say Hello, World.

Sometimes Unity can be a pain. I guess I'll have another shot at this in a bit.
